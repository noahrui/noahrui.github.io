             <p>Founded in 1990 by George and Jane Hancock, Maritime is Ballard-Proper's oldest brewery.</p>
              <P>Sticking with the nautical theme you'd expect from the neighborhood,</p>
               <p> you'll find lots of tasty beer options such as Flagship Red Ale, </p>
                <p>Islander Pale Ale and the Jolly Roger Christmas Ale that the taproom with named after.</p>

        <p>Stoup Brewing is a long held dream of Brad Benson and Lara Zahaba – two hopeless drink and chow hounds.
          <p>That the two found each other twenty years ago seems fated – Brad, a scientist to the very last DNA strand,</P>
            <p>would proffer a hypothesis based on proximity and human nature, we’re sure (ahem).</p>
              <p>Whatever your take, the takeaway is this: Brad loves beer and has been a loyal student, courter,</p>
               <p>and crafter for years that number beyond his fingers and toes.</p>
                <p>Lara loves all things gastro – from a savory plate to a smart pour.</p>
                 <p> The pair, professionally and recreationally, have spent the better part of their hours improving their palate’s quality of life.</p>
                  <p>It was only a matter of time before they ponied up and joined the community of talented purveyors.</P>
